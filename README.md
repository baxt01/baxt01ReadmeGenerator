# baxt01ReadmeGenerator
This CLI will generate a high quality readme.md file for github repos for open source projects to save the creator the time of doing this task so they can work on the creation process.
I have built this using nodejs and the inquirer package,
I have setup to call a series of prompts in the CLI then I process the inputs and add the info into a readme.md file giving a professional look and feel to the whole document.

There's all you should need to do is open you're terminal or cmd program then run the command,
npm i 
if you run this command in the root of your directory after cloning my repo to your local machine then you will install all the dependencies needed in this project.
then setup the directory structure as follows:

root directory;
